# Sample Ecommerce website using MERN Stack

This is a simple Ecommerce website made during my journey to get familiar with the MERN Stack i.e. MongoDB, Express, NodeJS and React and also to get familiar with the REST architectural style.

The project does not have a UI yet. So to test all of the routes of the project, we need to use postman and send JSON data to perform the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests
and create a database locally using mongodb.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Highcodger-10/Sample_Ecommerce_Website.git
```

Go to the project directory (backend as of now)

```bash
  cd Sample-Sample_Ecommerce_Website
```

```bash
  cd backend
```

Install dependencies (To install all the packages used in this project)

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

Or you can use this to start server using nodemon (if installed)

```bash
  npm run dev
```
To connect to the database locally, you can install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). 

If you have not already installed Nodejs, then head over [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install.

## Running Tests

Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test an API's functionality.

Postman can be easily used to test all the routes in this webapp. To download postman head over [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to do so.
